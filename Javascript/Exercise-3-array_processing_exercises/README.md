Here, I will do the exercises for array methods

Exercise 1

    Write a function filterRange(arr, a, b) that gets an array arr, looks for elements between a and b in it and returns an array of them.

    The function should not modify the array. It should return the new array. 

Exercises 2

    You have an array of user objects, each one has user.name. Write the code that converts it into an array of names.

Exercises 3

    Write the function getAverageAge(users) that gets an array of objects with property age and gets the average.

    The formula for the average is (age1 + age2 + ... + ageN) / N.
