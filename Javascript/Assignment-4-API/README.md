How to start:

    1. First of all, sign up to get an API KEY
    2. Get the URL of calling the API GET request.
    3. The URL consists of a protocol (https:// ), the Google Map API key, a search query to ask for specific searches such as Cat or Dog, or TV, the API Key, and finally, limit the query to limit the list of elements.
    4. Test the API in the browser. Do you see a JSON response? Then start building your application.

    1. HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap (optional)
    2. JavaScript page connected to the HTML
    3. An input field where you can put the text for the search query, with a button to submit the search input.
    4. XMLHttpRequest to make an API call to a Google Map server
    5. Display a result on the page HTML under the input, such as the picture above
