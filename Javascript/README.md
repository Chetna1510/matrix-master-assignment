1 - Variables and Conditionals:

Create a variable to store your age. Write a conditional statement to check if you are old enough to vote (age >= 18), and log a message accordingly.
Write a program that prompts the user for their name. If the name is "John," log "Hello, John!" to the console; otherwise, log "You are not John."

2 - Functions:

Write a function that takes two numbers as parameters and returns their sum. Call the function with different numbers to test it.
Create a function that accepts a string as a parameter and returns the string reversed. For example, "hello" should become "olleh."

3 - Arrays and Loops:

Create an array of your favorite fruits. Use a `for` loop to log each fruit to the console.
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the average of those numbers.
Given an array of numbers, use a loop to find and log the largest number in the array.
Create an array of words. Use a `for` loop to construct a sentence by concatenating these words and log it to the console.
Write a function that takes an array of names and a name as a parameter. The function should check if the given name exists in the array and return true or false.
Create an array of even numbers from 1 to 20 using a `for` loop and the `if` statement. Log the resulting array to the console.

4- Objects:

Create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, and year. Print the book's details to the console.
Define an object to represent a person with properties like name, age, and gender. Create a function that takes a person's object as a parameter and prints a message with their information.
5- Objects as Classes:

Create an object that simulates a class representing a car with properties like make, model, and year. Add a method to start the car.
Extend the previous car class object with a method to drive the car. Print a message when you start and drive the car instance.

6- Window Object:

Use the `window.alert` method to display an alert dialog with a message of your choice when a button is clicked on a webpage.
Create a function that uses `window.prompt` to ask the user for their name, then use `window.alert` to greet them with their name.

7- DOM Manipulation:

Create an HTML page with a button and a div element. Write a JavaScript function that changes the text content of the div when the button is clicked.
In an HTML page, create a list of items (e.g., a to-do list) using an unordered list (`<ul>`) and list items (`<li>`). Write JavaScript to add a new item to the list when a button is clicked.
Create a web page with an image and a button. Write JavaScript to change the image source when the button is clicked.
Build an interactive form in HTML (e.g., a simple login form) with input fields for username and password. Write JavaScript to validate the form when submitted. Display a message based on whether the login was successful or not.
