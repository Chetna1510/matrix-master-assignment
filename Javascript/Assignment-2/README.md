Task:
1- Create a simple HTML page with the following     elements:

    1. A form (<form>) with an id of my-form, containing:
    2. A heading (<h1>) that says "My Form".
    3. A text input field for the user to enter text.
    4. A submit button with the class btn and the text "Submit".
    5. An unordered list (<ul>) with the class items, containing three list items (<li>) labeled "Item 1", "Item 2", and "Item 3".

2- Add a button click event listener using JavaScript that performs the following actions when the submit button is clicked:

    1. Prevent the form from submitting and refreshing the page using e.preventDefault().
    2. Change the background color of the form (#my-form) to red.
    3. Add a new class called bg-dark to the <body> element. This class should change the background color of the entire webpage to dark (e.g., black or dark gray) and change the text color to white.
    4. Replace the last <li> element in the unordered list (ul.items) with an <h1> element that says "Hello".

3- CSS Styling:

    1. Style the bg-dark class to ensure the background turns dark and the text color becomes white.
    2. Add basic styles to the form, the button, and the list items.
